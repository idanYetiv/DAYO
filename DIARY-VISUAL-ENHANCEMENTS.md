# Diary Visual Enhancements - Ideas

**Status:** Brainstorming
**Date:** January 20, 2026

---

## 1. Mood Trends Graph

Show emotional patterns over time.

### Chart Options:
- **Line chart** - mood score (1-5) over days/weeks
- **Area chart** - filled, softer feel
- **Heat map** - GitHub-style grid, color intensity = mood
- **Sparkline** - minimal inline graph in header

### Time Ranges:
- 7 days
- 30 days
- 3 months
- Year

### Could Show:
- Average mood per week
- Best/worst days highlighted
- Correlation with habits completed

---

## 2. Color-Coded Calendar

Current state: Shows mood emoji on days.

### Enhancement Ideas:
- Background gradient based on mood (green = great, red = tough)
- Intensity rings - more content = thicker ring
- Multi-indicator dots: mood + photos + gratitude
- "Streak glow" on consecutive journal days

---

## 3. Photo Memories Carousel

Surface photos from entries visually.

### Ideas:
- Horizontal scroll of recent photos at top of diary
- "Photo wall" view - grid of all diary photos
- Random "memory" popup - "Remember this day?"
- Monthly photo collage auto-generated

---

## 4. Word Cloud

Visual representation of what you write about.

### Ideas:
- Monthly word cloud from diary text
- Tap a word to see entries containing it
- Track recurring themes over time
- Exclude common words, surface meaningful ones

---

## 5. Entry Richness Indicator

Show at a glance how "complete" each entry is.

### Visual Options:
- Progress ring (mood + text + photo + gratitude + highlights)
- Icon row showing what's filled
- "Journal score" badge

---

## 6. Year in Review / Monthly Recap

Auto-generated visual summary.

### Could Include:
- Most common mood
- Total entries written
- Photos grid
- Top gratitude themes
- Streak achievements
